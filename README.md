# Rockrentals

Working with Rockrentals, a property management company, offered me a unique opportunity to leverage my skills in both art direction and design in a real-world context. Rockrentals operates in a competitive space, requiring a standout brand and digital presence to attract both property owners and travelers. My role in this project was comprehensive, encompassing the creation of the company's branding, webpage, graphics, layout, icons, and infographics.

### My Role

As the art director and designer, I had the dual responsibility of setting the creative vision and executing it across various mediums. This involved developing a coherent brand identity that resonated with our target audiences, designing an intuitive and visually appealing website, and creating graphics and infographics that communicated complex information in an easily digestible format. My role was to ensure that every visual element aligned with Rockrentals' values and objectives, creating a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Design Process

My approach to this project was methodical, incorporating both creative intuition and strategic thinking:

1. **Interviewing Stakeholders:** I began by conducting interviews with key stakeholders, including travelers and travel agencies. These conversations provided valuable insights into the needs, preferences, and pain points of our target users, informing the direction of our branding and design efforts.

2. **Research and Insights Gathering:** Alongside interviews, I engaged in thorough research to gather additional insights into the property management industry, competitor branding, and design trends. This step was crucial for understanding the landscape in which Rockrentals operates and identifying opportunities to differentiate our brand.

3. **Brand Identity Development:** Armed with insights, I moved on to develop the brand identity for Rockrentals. This phase involved creating a visual language that reflected the company's values and appealed to our target audience, including the selection of color schemes, typography, and graphic elements.

4. **Webpage Design:** Designing the webpage was a key task, requiring careful consideration of layout, user experience, and visual appeal. I focused on creating a site that was not only aesthetically pleasing but also easy to navigate, ensuring that users could find the information they needed with minimal effort.

5. **Graphics, Layout, Icons, and Infographics:** For the graphics, layout, icons, and infographics, I applied cognitive, strategic, and practical tools to ensure that complex information was presented in a clear, engaging, and visually appealing manner. This involved experimenting with different designs and formats to best convey the desired messages.

6. **Iterative Design and Feedback:** Throughout the design process, I employed an iterative approach, regularly seeking feedback from the team and potential users to refine and improve the designs. This collaborative process helped to ensure that the final deliverables effectively met the needs of our target audiences.

7. **Finalization and Implementation:** The final step involved finalizing the designs and implementing them across the necessary platforms and materials. This phase required attention to detail and coordination to ensure consistency and quality in the brand's presentation.

This project with Rockrentals was a comprehensive exercise in branding and design, challenging me to apply my skills creatively and strategically to build a cohesive and compelling brand identity and digital presence. Through careful research, collaborative feedback, and iterative design, I aimed to create a visual identity that not only represented Rockrentals' values but also resonated with and attracted our target audiences.
